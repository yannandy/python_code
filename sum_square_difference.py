#The purpose is tof ind the difference between the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers and the square of the sum.
#For example, the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 385.
#The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is 3025.
#The difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
